== Planning to customize these templates? ==


Copy these template to your child theme and edit them there. 

The location for these new templates will be your "template override directory" ( default is /gbs/ ) and since you're working with the wraper templates here in the /public/ directory the copied files need to be pasted into the root of the "template override directory".

For example, editing the voucher.php file is easy:

1. Copy the voucher.php in this directory.
2. Paste it into /premium-child-theme/gbs/ ( e.g. themes/premium-child-theme/gbs/voucher.php ).
3. Start editing away at that new file.

== Have a custom theme? ==

These templates are very important to you. You'll want to copy all of these /public/ files into your child theme and modify the layouts so they match your custom theme.
