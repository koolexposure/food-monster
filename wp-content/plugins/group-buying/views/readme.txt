== Planning to customize these templates? ==

Copy these template to your child theme and edit them there. 

The location for these new templates will be your "template override directory" ( default is /gbs/ ). Make sure to follow the folder structure; unless you're working with templates in the /public/ folder, those go into the root directory, more about that in /public/readme.txt.

For example, editing the view.php file is easy:

1. Copy the view.php in the /account/ directory.
2. Paste it into /premium-child-theme/gbs/account/ ( e.g. themes/premium-child-theme/gbs/account/view.php ).
3. Start editing away.
